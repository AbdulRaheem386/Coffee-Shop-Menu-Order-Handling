# Coffee-Shop-Menu-Order-Handling
# ☕ Coffee Shop Menu & Order Handling – C++ OOP Project

This is a simple console-based C++ project that simulates a Coffee Shop's menu and order management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates how real-world problems like order processing, billing, and item filtering can be handled using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in C++.
